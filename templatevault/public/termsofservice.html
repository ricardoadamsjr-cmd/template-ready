          <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
          <p class="subtitle">
            These Terms of Service govern your use of Airstadt SiteFlow’s designs, services, and one‑of‑one website deployments.
          </p>
        </header>

        <div class="section-label">Ownership & licensing</div>
        <h2>1. Exclusive ownership & intellectual property policy</h2>
        <p>
          All website designs, layouts, animations, code, and creative assets produced by Airstadt SiteFlow are the
          exclusive intellectual property of Airstadt unless a separate Buyout Agreement is executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you purchase a design from our gallery, that specific layout and animation sequence becomes a
          <strong>One‑of‑One</strong> and is immediately “Vaulted.”
        </p>
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is permanently removed from our store</li>
          <li>It will never be resold or reused for another client</li>
          <li>Airstadt retains full ownership of the underlying design and code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You receive a non‑transferable, exclusive‑use license, not ownership.
        </p>

        <h2>2. License & subscription requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Your setup fee grants you the right to use the design only while your monthly service subscription remains active.
        </p>
        <p>If your subscription is canceled or payment lapses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your website will be taken offline</li>
          <li>Your license to use the design immediately terminates</li>
          <li>All files, code, and assets remain the property of Airstadt SiteFlow</li>
          <li>The design is stored in our private archive and cannot be used elsewhere</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may not copy, export, duplicate, or recreate the design without written permission.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Buyout option (optional)</h2>
        <p>
          If you wish to own your website outright and move it to your own hosting provider, a Buyout Fee of
          <strong>[Insert Amount, e.g., 2× your Setup Fee]</strong> is required.
        </p>
        <p>Upon payment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Airstadt will package the code and assets for transfer</li>
          <li>Ownership of the design is granted to you</li>
          <li>Airstadt’s ongoing responsibilities end</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that custom animations or effects may behave differently depending on your new hosting environment.
          Airstadt is not responsible for post‑transfer compatibility issues.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Mandatory brand attribution</h2>
        <p>
          All websites built by Airstadt SiteFlow include a small Airstadt logo and company credit in the footer.
        </p>
        <p>This attribution:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Must remain visible at all times</li>
          <li>Cannot be removed, hidden, or altered</li>
          <li>Is a condition of your license to use the design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Removing or modifying the attribution without written approval constitutes a breach of this agreement and may
          result in service termination or additional fees.
        </p>

        <div class="section-label">No‑contact project workflow</div>
        <h2>5. No‑contact studio policy</h2>
        <p>
          To maintain affordable pricing and fast delivery times, Airstadt SiteFlow operates as a <strong>No‑Contact Studio</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All communication is handled exclusively via email</li>
          <li>We do not offer phone calls, video calls, meetings, or live consultations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This policy ensures efficient workflows and protects project timelines.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Project intake form requirement</h2>
        <p>
          Immediately after payment, you will be directed to complete the Project Intake Form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your website will be written, designed, and built entirely based on the information you provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Airstadt may email you for essential clarifications to ensure accurate representation of your business; however,
          all communication will remain within our email‑only policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failure to provide complete or accurate information may delay your project. Airstadt is not responsible for delays
          caused by incomplete submissions.
        </p>

        <h2>7. The “Launch” guarantee</h2>
        <p>
          Your site will be delivered based on the content you provide in your Intake Form.
        </p>
        <p>
          At launch, you receive one Correction Pass, which covers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Typos</li>
          <li>Factual errors</li>
          <li>Incorrect business details you provided</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Correction Pass does not include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rewrites</li>
          <li>Redesigns</li>
          <li>New content</li>
          <li>Preference‑based changes</li>
          <li>Additional creative direction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any requests outside the scope of the Correction Pass will be billed as additional work.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Post‑launch edits & additional requests</h2>
        <p>
          Any changes requested after the site is live will be billed at the following rates:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content edits</li>
          <li>Design adjustments</li>
          <li>New sections or pages</li>
          <li>Functional additions</li>
          <li>Any revisions outside the included Correction Pass</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Rates will be provided upon request and must be approved before work begins. Payment is required before any
          additional work is performed.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Client responsibility</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for providing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accurate business information</li>
          <li>Correct spelling, details, and descriptions</li>
          <li>Timely responses to clarification emails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Airstadt is not liable for errors resulting from incomplete, inaccurate, or delayed information.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Acceptance of terms</h2>
        <p>
          By submitting payment and completing the Project Intake Form, you acknowledge and agree to all terms outlined on
          this page.
        </p>

If you tell me your exact brand hex colors and preferred font (e.g., Inter, Poppins), I can tweak this to match your system perfectly.
